# vignette-car-vision

Vignette on identifying objects such as pedestrians, traffic lights, and other road-side objects using computer vision. This was a project for PSTAT197A.

## Abstract
Self-driving cars need to be able to identify common entities on or alongside the road. The
dataset "Udacity Self-Driving Car" on Roboflow provided 15000 images of pedestrians,
cars, traffic lights, bikers, etc and labels containing the coordinates for those objects. The YOLOv7-PyTorch model classifies
the different potential roadside objects under 11 labels and assigns a probability that the object is of that given label.

## Repository Contents
The drafts folder contains the rough draft of the Jupyter Notebook used for the project.
